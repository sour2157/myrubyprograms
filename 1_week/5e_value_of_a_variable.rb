#Exercise 5. The following program prints the value of the variable. Why?

#my_string = 'Hello Ruby World'
#def my_string
#  'Hello World'
#end
#puts my_string






In the program the puts command is pointing to the variable name so its prints the value of the variable.
The method is never called so it never goes in there..
